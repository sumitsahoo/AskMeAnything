# AskMeAnything

A simple demo App which mimics Siri up to some point. Remember it is not Siri but it is no joke either thanks to WolframAlpha.

WolframAlpha API : https://developer.wolframalpha.com
Bing Image Search API : https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-image-search-api

To access API you need to register as developer and get APP ID (WolframAlpha) and Subscription Key (Bing Image Search). Then update the below lines.

WolframAlphaAPI Class : Change APP_ID.

public static final String APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID";

BingImageSearchAPI Class : Change SUBSCRIPTION_KEY;

public static final String SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";

Happy Coding !!

PS : Fork -> Improve -> Share -> Repeat. Open Source FTW.
