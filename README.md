# AskMeAnything

A simple demo App which mimics Siri up to some point. Remember it is not Siri but it is no joke either thanks to WolframAlpha.

And yeah you can also do cat gif search and long tap on a card to copy gif URL to share. To show Gifs Fresco (by Facebook) is used. More about Fresco : https://github.com/facebook/fresco

WolframAlpha API : https://developer.wolframalpha.com

Bing Image Search API : https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/bing-image-search-api

To access API you need to register as developer and get APP ID (WolframAlpha) and Subscription Key (Bing Image Search). Then update the below lines.

WolframAlphaAPI Class : Change APP_ID.

public static final String APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID";

BingImageSearchAPI Class : Change SUBSCRIPTION_KEY;

public static final String SUBSCRIPTION_KEY = "YOUR_KEY_HERE";
